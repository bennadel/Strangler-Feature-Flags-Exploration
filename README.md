# Strangler: Playing With Feature Flags In ColdFusion




## Running With CommandBox

This demo runs on Lucee CFML using CommandBox. To start the demo, `cd` into the `code` directory and run `server start`. There is a `server.json` file which should start a Lucee CFML server and open up the demo in the browser.

```sh
cd ./code
box
server start name=./server.json
```
